# Documentation Contribution Guide

High-quality documentation is the backbone of SveltyCMS. This guide provides a clear, actionable framework for all contributors—both human and AI—to create consistent, high-quality content.

---

## The Golden Rules: Core Principles

All contributions **must** adhere to these foundational rules.

> 1.  **MDX Only & Correct Locations**: All documentation files must be `.mdx` files and placed only in their designated canonical locations (see below).
> 2.  **Centralized API Docs**: All API documentation **must** be located in `/docs/api/` to provide a single, unified reference.
> 3.  **Current Functionality Only**: Document **only** what exists in the current codebase. Do not add documentation for planned features or unmerged changes.
> 4.  **Assets in `/static/docs`**: All non-MDX assets (images, diagrams) **must** be placed in `/static/docs/` and referenced via an absolute path.

---

## Canonical Documentation Locations

To eliminate ambiguity, all documentation must be placed in one of the following locations. No other locations are permitted.

### 1. API Documentation → `/docs/api/`

- **What:** The complete reference for all REST API endpoints.
- **Where:** `/docs/api/`
- **Why:** Centralizes the entire API surface in one place for a holistic, easy-to-navigate user experience.

### 2. Widget Documentation → `src/widgets/...`

- **What:** Documentation for a specific widget.
- **Where:** `src/widgets/core/[widget-folder]/[widget-name].mdx`
- **Why:** Co-locating documentation with the widget's source code makes it self-contained and easier to maintain.

### 3. General Documentation → `/docs/...`

- **What:** All other guides, tutorials, and explanations (including this one).
- **Where:** Sub-folders within `/docs/` (e.g., `/docs/guides/`, `/docs/contributing/`).
- **Why:** Provides a central library for all topic-based information that isn't tied to a specific widget or API endpoint.

---

## Instructions for Documentation Creation

To maintain consistency and quality, all contributors should adhere to the following workflow and rules.

### Guiding Principles

- **Act as an Expert:** Write as an expert technical writer for the SveltyCMS project.
- **Goal:** Produce clear, accurate, and perfectly formatted documentation that is easy for all users to understand.
- **Voice:** Professional, direct, and concise. Use American English.

### Authoring Workflow

1.  **Analyze Context:** Before writing, thoroughly analyze the request, existing code, and related documentation to understand the goal.
2.  **Adhere to Rules:** Follow all rules in this guide, especially the **Golden Rules** and the **Frontmatter Guide**.
3.  **Write Content:** Create the MDX content, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and practical examples.
4.  **Validate Frontmatter:** Ensure the YAML frontmatter is complete, correct, and matches the file's location and content.
5.  **Verify Paths:** Double-check that all asset and internal links use correct, absolute paths.

### Core Authoring Rules

- **ALWAYS** place documentation in the correct canonical location as defined above.
- **ALWAYS** ensure the `path` field in the frontmatter is the exact, full path of the file from the project root.
- **NEVER** create `.md` files. Only create `.mdx` files.
- **NEVER** place images or other assets anywhere except `/static/docs/`.

## Frontmatter Guide

Every MDX file must begin with a YAML frontmatter block enclosed by `---` lines. This metadata is critical for navigation, search, and display.

### Required Fields

## Managing Assets (Images, Diagrams, Videos)

All non-MDX files must be placed in the `/static/docs/` directory to keep documentation folders clean.

### Rules

- **Location**: `/static/docs/`
- **Structure**: Mirror the `/docs/` directory structure
- **Example**: Image for `/docs/api/Authentication_2FA_API.mdx` goes in `/static/docs/api/`

### Referencing Assets

Always use absolute paths from the root:

```markdown
![2FA Setup Flow](/docs/api/2fa-setup-flow.png)
```

### Asset Guidelines

- **Formats**: PNG for screenshots, SVG for diagrams/icons
- **Optimization**: Keep files under 500KB
- **Naming**: Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `api-authentication-flow.svg`)
- **Alt Text**: Always provide meaningful alt text for accessibility

---

## Content Best Practices

### Writing Style

- **Clarity**: Use active voice, short sentences, plain language
- **Structure**: Start with intro, use H2/H3 headings, end with summary or next steps
- **Examples**: Provide practical code snippets and real-world examples
- **Consistency**: Follow existing doc style. Use American English.
- **Accessibility**: Add alt text, ensure good contrast, make content scannable

### MDX-Specific Guidance

- **Basic Markdown**: Use standard syntax (bold, italics, lists, links, code blocks with language tags)
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```typescript
// TypeScript code here
```
````

- **JSX Components**: Use sparingly, only for interactive elements
- **Escaping**: Use backticks or HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`) for literal angle brackets

## Review and Update Process

### Pull Request Workflow

1. **Create Branch**: Make documentation changes in a feature branch
2. **Run Linter**: Execute `bun ./docs/lint-docs.ts` and fix any errors
3. **Submit PR**: Create pull request with descriptive title
4. **Review**: Reviewers check for accuracy, clarity, and adherence to guidelines
5. **Update `updated` field**: Change the date in frontmatter
6. **Merge**: Once approved, changes are merged

### Updating Existing Docs

- Always update the `updated` field in frontmatter
- Keep changes focused on one topic per PR
- Add a commit message explaining what changed

### Versioning

- Documentation is versioned with the code
- Major changes may need release notes
- Breaking API changes must be documented immediately

---

## Checklist for New Documentation

- [ ] **Correct Location**: The file is in its designated canonical location.
- [ ] Frontmatter is complete with all required fields.
- [ ] `path` field matches actual file location.
- [ ] Content is clear, accurate, and follows best practices.
- [ ] Code examples are tested and working.
- [ ] Assets are in `/static/docs/` with correct structure.
- [ ] File is `.mdx` format (not `.md`).

## Tools and Validation

### Frontmatter Linter

To ensure all documentation is valid, run the linter before submitting a pull request. This tool checks files in both `docs/` and `src/widgets/`.

```bash
bun ./docs/lint-docs.ts
```

This tool validates all `.mdx` files, reports errors, and identifies any `.md` files that need to be converted. A passing linter is a requirement for merging.

The linter will:

- ✅ Validate all `.mdx` files in `docs/` and `src/widgets/` directories
- 🔍 Detect `.md` files that need conversion to `.mdx`
- ❌ Report frontmatter errors with helpful messages
- 📊 Display summary with validation results

**Always run the linter before submitting a PR.**
