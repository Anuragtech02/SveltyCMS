## Overview

The system state machine is a central orchestrator that:

- **Tracks System States**: `IDLE` → `INITIALIZING` → `READY`/`DEGRADED`/`FAILED`
- **Monitors Services**: Database, Auth, Cache, ContentManager, ThemeManager
- **Self-Learning**: Automatically calibrates thresholds every 10 health checks
- **Detects Anomalies**: 5 types with 4 severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- **Tracks Performance**: Startup, shutdown, idle, and active state metrics
- **Smart Timeouts**: Calculated from historical data (3x average or 1.5x max)
- **Public APIs**: Health check and performance endpoints for monitoring tools

**Benefits for Users:**

- ✅ No manual configuration needed
- ✅ Automatic performance optimization
- ✅ Early warning of system issues
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring endpoints

**Benefits for Developers:**

- ✅ Clear system state at all times
- ✅ Non-blocking health checks (87-96% faster requests)
- ✅ Detailed performance metrics
- ✅ Easy integration with external monitoring

## Core State Machine

### System States

The state machine manages five explicit states:

| State          | Description                                      | When It Occurs                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `IDLE`         | Server started, no initialization begun          | Initial startup, after shutdown     |
| `INITIALIZING` | System initialization in progress                | During `initializeSystem()`         |
| `READY`        | All critical services healthy and operational    | Normal running state                |
| `DEGRADED`     | Non-critical service failed, core CMS functional | Optional service down (e.g., cache) |
| `FAILED`       | Critical service failed, system not operational  | Database connection failed          |

**State Transitions:**

```
SERVER START
    ↓
  IDLE
    ↓ (initializeSystem called)
INITIALIZING
    ↓
    ├─→ READY (all services healthy)
    ├─→ DEGRADED (non-critical service unhealthy)
    └─→ FAILED (critical service unhealthy)
```

The overall state is **automatically derived** from individual service health—no manual state management needed!

### Service Health

Each service reports its health status:

| Service            | Status                                 | Description                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **database**       | `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `initializing` | MongoDB/database connection state       |
| **auth**           | `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `initializing` | Authentication service readiness        |
| **cache**          | `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `initializing` | Media, revisions, virtual folders cache |
| **contentManager** | `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `initializing` | Collection and widget management        |
| **themeManager**   | `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `initializing` | Theme system availability               |

**Critical Services** (system becomes `FAILED` if unhealthy):

- Database
- Auth

**Non-Critical Services** (system becomes `DEGRADED` if unhealthy):

- Cache
- ContentManager
- ThemeManager

---

## AI-Like Self-Learning Features

### 1. Automatic Threshold Calibration

Every **10 health checks**, the system automatically recalibrates performance thresholds based on actual behavior:

```typescript
// Startup threshold: 3x average OR 1.5x max (whichever is larger)
maxStartupTime = Math.max(
  avgStartupTime * 3,
  maxStartupTime * 1.5
);

// Adaptive failure tolerance based on reliability
if (uptime > 99%) {
  maxConsecutiveFailures = 2;  // Strict for reliable services
} else if (uptime > 95%) {
  maxConsecutiveFailures = 3;
} else {
  maxConsecutiveFailures = 5;  // Lenient for struggling services
}
```

**What This Means:**

- Fast systems get stricter thresholds (catches small slowdowns)
- Slow systems get lenient thresholds (avoids false alarms)
- Reliable services get stricter failure limits
- System adapts to YOUR infrastructure automatically

### 2. Performance Trend Detection

The system compares each measurement to the previous average:

```typescript
if (currentTime < previousAvg * 0.9) {
	trend = 'improving'; // 10% faster! 🚀
} else if (currentTime > previousAvg * 1.1) {
	trend = 'degrading'; // 10% slower ⚠️
} else {
	trend = 'stable'; // All good ✅
}
```

**Use Cases:**

- Identify performance regressions after deployments
- Track system improvement over time
- Detect gradual degradation before it becomes critical

### 3. Anomaly Detection

The system automatically detects **5 types of anomalies**:

| Anomaly Type              | Detection Logic            | Severity                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Slow Startup**          | Startup time > threshold   | HIGH/CRITICAL if >100% over |
| **Slow Shutdown**         | Shutdown time > threshold  | MEDIUM/HIGH                 |
| **Consecutive Failures**  | Multiple failures in a row | CRITICAL if ≥2x max         |
| **Low Uptime**            | Reliability < 90%          | MEDIUM/HIGH                 |
| **Degrading Performance** | Trend = 'degrading'        | LOW/MEDIUM                  |

**Severity Levels:**

- **CRITICAL**: Immediate attention required (>100% over threshold, 2x consecutive failures)
- **HIGH**: Serious issue (>50% over threshold, consecutive failures reached)
- **MEDIUM**: Needs investigation (2-4x baseline, high variance, restarts)
- **LOW**: Minor concern (slightly slow, 2-5 failures)

### 4. State-Specific Timing

The system tracks **4 distinct phases** for each service:

**Startup** (IDLE → INITIALIZING → READY):

- Count, average, min, max, last time
- Performance trend (improving/stable/degrading)

**Shutdown** (READY → IDLE):

- Count, average, min, max, last time
- Performance trend

**Idle** (time spent in IDLE state):

- Count of idle periods, average, min, max
- Total idle time

**Active** (time spent in READY state):

- Count of active periods, average, min, max
- Total active time

## Implementation Guide

### For Developers: Using the State Machine

#### Check System Readiness (Synchronous)

```typescript
import { isSystemReady, isServiceHealthy } from '@stores/system';

// Check overall system
if (isSystemReady()) {
	// System is READY, proceed with request
}

// Check specific service
if (isServiceHealthy('auth')) {
	// Auth service is healthy, can authenticate
}
```

#### Wait for System Readiness (Asynchronous)

These functions now support an `options` object with `timeoutMs` and a standard `AbortSignal` for robust asynchronous control.

```typescript
import { waitForSystemReady, waitForServiceHealthy } from '@stores/system';

// Set up a controller for cancellation
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

// Example: Wait for the overall system with a 5-second timeout
try {
	const isReady = await waitForSystemReady({ timeoutMs: 5000, signal });
	if (isReady) {
		console.log('System is ready!');
	} else {
		console.warn('System did not become ready in time.');
	}
} catch (error) {
	// This will be a DOMException if the operation was aborted
	console.error('Wait was aborted:', error.name); // 'AbortError'
}

// You can abort the wait from anywhere else in your code
// controller.abort();

// Example: Wait for a specific service
await waitForServiceHealthy('database', { timeoutMs: 2000 });
```

#### Report Service Health

```typescript
import { updateServiceHealth, startServiceInitialization } from '@stores/system';

// Start tracking initialization
startServiceInitialization('myService');

try {
	await initializeMyService();
	updateServiceHealth('myService', 'healthy', 'Service initialized successfully');
} catch (error) {
	updateServiceHealth('myService', 'unhealthy', 'Initialization failed', error.message);
}
```

#### Update System State

```typescript
import { setSystemState } from '@stores/system';

// Manually set system state (usually done automatically)
setSystemState('INITIALIZING', 'Starting system initialization');
```

### For Users: Monitoring System Health

#### Dashboard Widget

Navigate to **Dashboard** → **System Health Widget**

The widget shows:

- Overall system status (color-coded)
- Individual service health cards
- System uptime
- Reinitialize button (admin only)
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

#### Full Health Monitor

Navigate to **Config** → **System Health** (`/config/system-health`)

Features:

- Real-time status display
- Manual refresh button
- Auto-refresh toggle
- Service grid with detailed status
- Performance metrics
- Anomaly alerts

#### External Monitoring

Use health endpoint in monitoring tools:

**Kubernetes:**

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/system/health
    port: 5173
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  periodSeconds: 5

readinessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /api/system/health
    port: 5173
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 3
```

**Uptime Monitor (Uptime Robot, Pingdom):**

- URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/system/health`
- Expected: HTTP 200 with `"overallStatus": "READY"`

## Performance Metrics

### Baseline Expectations

Expected initialization times for each service:

| Service        | Expected | Warning Threshold |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| Database       | 500ms    | >1000ms           |
| Auth           | 50ms     | >100ms            |
| Cache          | 200ms    | >400ms            |
| ContentManager | 300ms    | >600ms            |
| ThemeManager   | 200ms    | >400ms            |

**These are starting values—system automatically calibrates to YOUR infrastructure!**

### Request Performance Impact

Before state machine (blocking `await`):

- Every request waited for initialization: **+1500ms**

After state machine (non-blocking checks):

- Synchronous health checks: **<1ms**
- **87-96% faster requests** during startup

### Service Metrics

For each service, the system tracks:

| Metric          | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `avgInitTime`   | Average initialization time (self-learning)           |
| `minInitTime`   | Fastest initialization recorded                       |
| `maxInitTime`   | Slowest initialization recorded                       |
| `reliability`   | Success rate (healthChecks - failures) / healthChecks |
| `failureCount`  | Number of times service became unhealthy              |
| `restartCount`  | Number of times service was restarted                 |
| `lastFailureAt` | Timestamp of last failure                             |

## Integration with Setup Flow

The state machine integrates with the setup wizard:

1. **Setup Mode**: System stays in `IDLE`, no services initialized
2. **Test Database**: Temporary adapter created (not tracked by state machine)
3. **Complete Setup**:
   - Writes `config/private.ts` with database credentials
   - Calls `initializeSystem()` which reports to state machine
   - State transitions: `IDLE` → `INITIALIZING` → `READY`
   - All services report health
4. **Post-Setup**: System remains in `READY` state, accepting requests

**Key Fix Applied:**

- Setup completion preserves `privateEnv` during initialization
- No server restart required after setup
- Seamless transition from setup to production mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### System Stuck in INITIALIZING

**Check logs for:**

```
System state changed: IDLE → INITIALIZING
Service database health updated: initializing → ???
```

**Possible causes:**

- Database connection timeout
- Network issues
- Invalid credentials in `config/private.ts`

**Solution:**

- Check database connectivity: `bun run scripts/check-mongodb.js`
- Verify `config/private.ts` has correct credentials
- Check logs: `tail -f logs/app.log`

### System Shows DEGRADED

**What it means:**

- Core CMS is functional
- A non-critical service (cache, contentManager, themeManager) is unhealthy

**Actions:**

- Check which service is unhealthy: `GET /api/system/health`
- Review logs for that specific service
- Non-critical services can fail without stopping the CMS

### Service Shows Low Reliability

**What it means:**

- Service is repeatedly failing health checks
- Reliability = (healthChecks - failures) / healthChecks

**Actions:**

- Check for resource constraints (memory, CPU)
- Review service-specific logs
- Look for anomaly alerts in performance metrics

### Anomaly Alerts

**CRITICAL severity:**

- Immediate attention required
- Service taking >2x expected time
- Multiple consecutive failures

**HIGH severity:**

- Serious issue, investigate soon
- Service >50% over threshold
- Consecutive failures reached

**MEDIUM severity:**

- Needs investigation when convenient
- Service 2-4x baseline
- Recent restarts

**LOW severity:**

- Minor concern, monitor
- Slightly slower than usual
- 2-5 failures recorded
