# System State & Health Architecture

This document outlines the plan to evolve the application's startup and runtime management from simple flags to a robust **state machine**. This architecture improves stability, performance (by reducing unnecessary `await` calls), and provides critical observability for a professional CMS.

## The Core State Machine

A central store will manage the entire application's readiness with five explicit states:

-   `IDLE`: The server has started, but no initialization has begun.
-   `INITIALIZING`: The main `initializeSystem()` process is running.
-   `READY`: All critical services are initialized and healthy. The CMS is fully operational.
-   `DEGRADED`: A non-critical service has failed, but the core CMS can still function.
-   `FAILED`: A critical service (e.g., Database) has failed. The system is not operational.

The overall state of the system is **derived** from the collective health of its individual services.

## Health Checks for Individual Services

Each major service (Database, Cache, ThemeManager, etc.) will be responsible for reporting its own health status (`'healthy'`, `'unhealthy'`, `'initializing'`) to the central state store. This modular approach allows for pinpointing exactly which part of the system is having issues.

## The `GET /api/health` Endpoint

This public API endpoint will be the face of the state machine, providing a detailed, machine-readable report invaluable for production monitoring, load balancers, and CI/CD pipelines.

```json
{
  "overallStatus": "READY",
  "components": {
    "database": { "status": "healthy", "message": "Connection successful." },
    "cache": { "status": "healthy", "message": "Redis connection successful." }
  }
}

```
