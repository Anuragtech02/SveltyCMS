/**
 * @file src/hooks.server.ts
 * @description Hook middleware pipeline with unified metrics and automated security response
 *
 * This file orchestrates a streamlined sequence of middleware to handle
 * all incoming server requests. The architecture emphasizes security, observability,
 * and performance with unified metrics collection and automated threat detection.
 *
 * Middleware Sequence:
 * 1. System state validation (gatekeeper)
 * 2. Setup completion enforcement (installation gate)
 * 3. CSP nonce generation (XSS prevention)
 * 4. Authentication & session management (identity)
 * 5. Authorization & access control (security)
 * 6. Security headers with nonce-based CSP (defense in depth)
 *
 * Core Services:
 * - MetricsService: Unified performance & security monitoring
 * - SecurityResponseService: Automated threat detection & response
